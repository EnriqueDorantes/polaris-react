# Button

Buttons are used to make common actions immediately visible and easy to perform with one click, tap or keypress. Merchants can use it to navigate, or take action.

---

## Best practices

Buttons should:

- Be clearly and accurately labeled.
- Lead with strong, actionable verbs.
- Use established button colors appropriately. For example, only use a red
  button for an action that’s difficult or impossible to undo.
- Prioritize the most important actions. Too many calls to action can cause
  confusion and make merchants unsure of what to do next.
- Be positioned in consistent locations in the interface.

## Content guidelines

Buttons should be clear and predictable—merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a button. Never deceive merchants by mislabeling a button.

Read the [actionable language guidelines](/content/actionable-language) to learn what to label buttons for different states in web, iOS, and Android.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

- Create order
- Buy shipping label

#### Don’t

- New order
- Buy

<!-- end -->

Buttons should always lead with a strong verb that encourages
action. To provide enough context to merchants use the {verb}+{noun} format on
buttons except in the case of common actions like Save, Close, Cancel, or OK.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

- Activate Apple Pay
- View shipping settings

#### Don’t

- Try Apple Pay
- View your settings

<!-- end -->

Buttons should be scannable—avoid unnecessary words and articles such as the, an, or a.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

Add menu item

#### Don’t

Add a menu item

## Examples

### Basic button

Used most in the interface. Only use another style if a button requires more or less visual weight.

```jsx
<Button>Add product</Button>
```

<!-- content-for: android -->

![Basic button for Android](components/Button/android/basic.png)

<!-- /content-for -->

<!-- content-for: ios -->

![Basic button for iOS](components/Button/ios/basic.png)

<!-- /content-for -->

### Outline button

<!-- example-for: web -->

Use against shaded or colorful backgrounds. An outline button will maintain the appropriate visual weight and won’t clash with the background color.

```jsx
<Button outline>Add product</Button>
```

### Plain button

Use for less important or less commonly used actions since they’re less prominent. For example, plain buttons are used as actions in cards.

```jsx
<Button plain>View shipping settings</Button>
```

<!-- content-for: android -->

![Plain button for Android](components/Button/android/plain.png)

<!-- /content-for -->

<!-- content-for: ios -->

![Plain button for iOS](components/Button/ios/plain.png)

<!-- /content-for -->

### Primary button

Use to highlight the most important actions in any experience. Don’t use more than one primary button in a section or screen to avoid overwhelming merchants.

```jsx
<Button primary>Save theme</Button>
```

<!-- content-for: android -->

![Primary button for Android](components/Button/android/primary.png)

<!-- /content-for -->

<!-- content-for: ios -->

![Primary button for iOS](components/Button/ios/primary.png)

<!-- /content-for -->

### Destructive button

Use when the action will delete merchant data or be otherwise difficult to recover from. Destructive buttons should trigger a confirmation dialog before the action is completed. Be thoughtful about using destructive buttons because they can feel stressful for merchants.

```jsx
<Button destructive>Delete theme</Button>
```

<!-- content-for: android -->

![Destrutive plain and destructive basic button for Android](components/Button/android/destructive.png)

<!-- /content-for -->

<!-- content-for: ios -->

![Destrutive plain and destructive basic button for iOS](components/Button/ios/destructive.png)

<!-- /content-for -->

### Slim button

<!-- example-for: web -->

Use when a table or list has a set of actions on each item to avoid making items taller than they need to be. Don’t use slim buttons for primary actions.

```jsx
<Button size="slim">Save variant</Button>
```

### Large button

<!-- example-for: web -->

Use for the main call to action in empty states or for calls to action shown with large illustrations.

```jsx
<Button size="large">Create store</Button>
```

### Full-width button

<!-- example-for: web -->

Use for buttons placed in a narrow column (especially when stacking multiple buttons) or for creating a set of buttons of equal width. Full-width buttons should rarely exceed 320 px wide.

```jsx
<Button fullWidth>Add customer</Button>
```

### Disabled state

Use for actions that aren’t currently available. The surrounding interface should make it clear why the button is disabled and what needs to be done to enable it.

```jsx
<Button disabled>Buy shipping label</Button>
```

<!-- content-for: android -->

![Disabled primary button for Android](components/Button/android/disabled.png)

<!-- /content-for -->

<!-- content-for: ios -->

![Disabled primary button for iOS](components/Button/ios/disabled.png)

<!-- /content-for -->

### Loading state

<!-- example-for: web -->

Use when a button has been pressed and the associated action is in progress.

```jsx
<Button loading>Save product</Button>
```

<!-- content-for: web -->

---

### Accessibility

#### Labeling

The `accessibilityLabel` prop adds an `aria-label` attribute to the Button, which can be accessed by assistive technologies like screen readers. Typically, this text will be read in place of the visible text on the button for assistive technology users.

For a Button, `accessibilityLabel` should be used if:

- The visible text of the Button is not sufficient for non-visual users to understand the purpose of the Button in the context of the page.
- The Button has no text and relies on an icon instead to convey its purpose.

To help support people who use speech activation software and sighted screen reader users, make sure that the `aria-label` text includes any button text that is visible. Mismatches in visible and programmatic labeling can cause confusion, and can cause voice recognition commands to not work.

When possible, give the button visible text that clearly conveys its purpose without the use of `accessibilityLabel`. Duplicating the Button text with `accessibilityLabel` when no additional content is needed is not necessary.

#### Keyboard support

Keyboard users will expect to be able to give buttons keyboard focus with the `tab` key, and to activate them with the `enter`/`return` and `space` keys.
